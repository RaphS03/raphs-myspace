# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Raphael Schwalb needs a professional online presence to showcase his work, skills, and background as a software engineer. As a final-year student at Monash University and an engineer at an AI startup, having a polished personal website serves as both a portfolio and a professional landing page.

## Problems It Solves
- Provides a central place to present projects, experience, and skills to recruiters and collaborators
- Replaces scattered profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn) with a curated, designed experience
- Acts as a living resume that can be updated incrementally
- Demonstrates technical ability through the website itself (modern stack, clean code)

## How It Should Work
- **Home page**: Introduction/hero section with a brief summary of who Raph is, what he does, and quick navigation to key sections
- **Projects page**: Grid/list of projects with tags, descriptions, and links. Each project has a detail page (`/projects/[slug]`)
- **Resume page**: Professional experience, education, and skills presented in a clean format
- **Contact page**: Ways to get in touch (email, social links, potentially a contact form)

## User Experience Goals
- Fast page loads (static generation where possible)
- Clean, distraction-free reading experience
- Easy navigation between sections
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessible (proper semantic HTML, contrast ratios, keyboard navigation)
- Dark mode support for user preference
