# Copywriting & Tone

## Overview

Voice and tone guidelines for all text content on Raph's MySpace. The site should feel professional but human -- like talking to a smart, friendly engineer.

## Voice Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Professional** | Demonstrates competence and credibility |
| **Approachable** | Warm, not cold or corporate |
| **Confident** | States abilities directly, no hedging |
| **Concise** | Respects the reader's time |
| **Slightly casual** | Relaxed but not sloppy |

## Person and Perspective

- Use **first person** ("I", "my") in body copy
- Use **third person** ("Raphael Schwalb") only in metadata, structured data, or formal contexts
- Address the reader directly when appropriate ("you", "your")

```
// Good
"I'm a software engineer building tools that help people work smarter."

// Bad
"Raphael Schwalb is a software engineer who builds tools."

// Also bad
"Welcome to my website! I'm so excited to share my work with you!!!"
```

## Tone by Context

### Home Page Hero

Confident, memorable, concise. This is the first impression.

```
Good: "Software engineer. Problem solver. Currently building at [Company]."
Bad:  "Welcome to my personal website where you can learn about me and my projects."
```

### Project Descriptions

Technical but accessible. Lead with what it does, then how.

```
Good: "A real-time price comparison engine processing 50K+ products across major retailers."
Bad:  "This project was built using Python and Azure Functions with Cosmos DB."
```

### Resume / Experience

Professional, factual, achievement-oriented. Use strong action verbs.

```
Good: "Developed a real-time analytics pipeline reducing data latency by 40%."
Bad:  "Worked on analytics features for the team."
```

### Contact Page

Friendly, inviting, low-friction.

```
Good: "Got a project idea or opportunity? I'd love to hear about it."
Bad:  "Please fill out the form below to contact me."
```

## Writing Rules

### Do

- Start with action verbs in project descriptions and resume bullets
- Front-load important information (inverted pyramid)
- Use short sentences and paragraphs
- Use specific numbers and outcomes when possible
- Write alt text that describes the actual image content
- Write meta descriptions that make people want to click

### Do Not

- Do not use buzzwords without meaning ("synergy", "leverage", "cutting-edge")
- Do not use filler phrases ("In today's world...", "As you may know...")
- Do not use more than one exclamation mark per page
- Do not be self-deprecating ("just a student", "small project")
- Do not start sentences with "I" repeatedly (vary sentence structure)
- Do not use passive voice when active is clearer

## Content Length Guidelines

| Content Type | Target Length |
|-------------|-------------|
| Hero tagline | 5-10 words |
| Hero subtitle | 15-25 words |
| Project card description | 20-40 words |
| Project detail intro | 2-3 sentences |
| Resume bullet point | 1-2 lines |
| Meta description | 150-160 characters |
| Alt text | 10-20 words |

## Capitalization

- **Headings**: Title Case for page headings, sentence case for subheadings
- **Buttons**: Title Case ("View Projects", "Get in Touch")
- **Navigation**: Title Case ("Home", "Projects", "Resume", "Contact")
- **Tags/Badges**: As-is for proper nouns ("React", "TypeScript"), lowercase for generic ("full-stack", "web app")
